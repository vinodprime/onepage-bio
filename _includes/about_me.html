            I have over 5 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            mostly at banking sector projects. While I'm a proficient Java
            developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (Java,Spring,Hibernate,Web Services,API services).
        </p>
        <p>
           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
	   I'm always interested in becoming a better technology leader, and meeting interesting people.
